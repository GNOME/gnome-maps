## Design License

The look and feel of the OSM liberty map design is also derived (although heavily altered) from [OSM Bright from Mapbox Open Styles](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-styles/blob/master/LICENSE.md) which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

The map is displaying and styling the data from [OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.org/) with [CC-BY 4.0 design license](https://github.com/openmaptiles/openmaptiles/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

The products or services using this map style need to visibly credit "OpenMapTiles.org" or reference "OpenMapTiles" with a link to http://openmaptiles.org/. For a browsable electronic map based on OpenMapTiles and OpenStreetMap data, the credit should appear in the corner of the map. For example:

[© OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.org/)
[© OpenStreetMap contributors](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)

For printed and static maps a similar attribution should be made in a textual description near the image, in the same fashion as if you cite a photograph.

## Icons

OSM Liberty is using the [Maki POI icon set](https://github.com/mapbox/maki/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) which is licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal.

The right arrow was derived from [Wikipedia][wiki_arrow] which is in the public domain.

## Fonts

OSM Liberty is using the Roboto font family (Copyright 2011 Google).
Roboto is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://github.com/google/roboto/blob/master/LICENSE).
