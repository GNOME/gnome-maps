SCRIPTS
=======

extractPoiTypesFromID.js
------------------------

Extracts the POI types (presets) that the iD editor uses to JSON for us to consume.

Run the extractPoiTypesFromID.js script against a checkout of the
iD Tagging Schema project (https://github.com/openstreetmap/id-tagging-schema)

$ ./extractPoiTypesFromID.js <path to iD checkout> > osm-types.json

This script would be run by upstream before making a release of gnome-maps if an updated version
of the iD editor is available with updated OSM types preset and/or new or updated translations
of those.
Check the resulting .json file (i.e. check size and possibly diff against the current version).
Copy the result to data/osm-types.json
